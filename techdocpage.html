                    <p>
                       In this article, we will go over some of the highlights of Float, Flex, and Grid.
                        In the simplest terms, these three HTML/CSS features are used to organize the elements on our Webpage.
                        As we will see in the following paragraph, some of these features are more efficient in certain situations
                        than others.<br>
                            <h4>What you will need.</h4>
                                <ul id="paragraph-lists">

                                    <li class="pli">A basic understanding of css.</li>
                                </ul>
                
                    </p>  
        
            </section> 
            <section class="main-section">

                    <p>
                        Depending on the layout you are trying to achieve, using one of these features may be more efficient than another. 
                        Each of these features has drawbacks that should serve to prevent you from using it in certain situations.
                        This does not only apply to how these features affect webpage elements, but also in how easy/difficult they 
                        are to set up in the first place. Grid, as we will see, allows us to divide the elements of our webpage in two-dimensions,
                        meaning the feature can be implemented to affect both the columns and rows of a given container.
                        This might not be necessary in a situation where we only want to affect container elements according 
                        to their position along either an x or a y axis. In a situation such as this, flex might be a better decision,
                        as it is typically less time-consuming to set up than grid, but will get the job done nonetheless. An argument
                        could be made that floats are even less difficult to set up than flex, and also require less forethought before
                        implementing. This may come at the expense of more specific control of your webpage elements further on, and 
                        so it is entirely relative to your situation. I encourage you to keep that in mind as you continue reading this article.

                <h3 id="Floats"> Floats </h3> 
                    <p>
                        The Float property was originally introduced to move block-level elements around a page more easily. As it is the oldest
                        of the features in this article, it may come as no surprise that it offers the least amount of control over webpage elements, especially
                        in relation to one another. 
                        <br><br>
                        Float, in its simplest terms, allows us to move block-level elements to either the right or the left in our webpage. This allows other content
                        to wrap around these block-level elements, which can be used to very easily create a sense of cohesion to our webpages. Before the option to float existed,
                        this could only be achieved by very specifically setting margins and padding to fixed block-elements. This, as I can only imagine, must have been very 
                        time-consuming.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because we have less control over multiple elements simultaneously using floats, there is less syntax involved in implementing float to block-level elements.
                        First we apply the following to a given element.
                           <pre class="code"><code> display:block;</code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>     
                        Once we set the display of the element in question to block, we can then use float to shift it over to the right or left side of our webpage by using one of the following options:
                    </p>
                        <pre class="code"><code> float:left;</code></pre>
                        <pre class="code"><code> float:right;</code></pre>
                    
                    <p>
                        <b>NOTE</b> certain elements in html are automatically considered block-level elements. Paragraphs, headers, and forms are just a few of the long-list of elements that are inherently 
                        block-level. When floating one of these items, you do not have to set the display to block as it is already considered block-level.

                <h3 id="Flex"> Flex </h3> 
                    <p>
                        Flexbox is as a one-dimensional display module. In this case, one dimensional means that it affects all elements along either a row or a column.  Although Flexbox can do either direction, it does not 
                        do both directions in the same instance. Flexbox offers control over multiple html elements simultaneously. It functions in a parent-child relationship, with the container element being designated as the parent element, 
                        and all items within that container element as child elements. Flexbox allows for quick and easy webpage organization. Using syntax that we will see below, Flexbox is able to move multiple child elements in a certain
                        direction together, and also space each of these child items evenly along an axis. 
                    </p> 
                        <br>
                    <p>
                        In order to initiate Flexbox on a group of items, we must first assign the role of parent to an individual element. In order to do this, we use the following syntax on a block item that holds other items within it.
                        <pre class="code"><code> display:flex </code></pre>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All items within this parent element are now modified according to the specifications we make within this parernt element. First we decide whether the child elements will be displayed in rows or columns. By default,
                        flex items are displayed in rows, so just initializing flex will serve to organize child elements along the x-axis. If we would prefer the items to be positioned vertically we can achieve this by entering the following syntax
                        in our flex-container.
                        <pre class="code"><code> display:flex; </code></pre> 
                        <pre class="code"><code> flex-direction:column;</code></pre>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After we've decided whether our flexed child-elements will be displayed in a row or column, we can further manipulate there layout in terms of there spacing and even the order in which they are displayed.
